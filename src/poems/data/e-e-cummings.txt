 I will wade out
                    	   till my thighs are steeped in burn-
ing flowers
I will take the sun in my mouth
and leap into the ripe air
                                	   	Alive
                                            	               with closed eyes
to dash against darkness
                                	  in the sleeping curves of my
body
Shall enter fingers of smooth mastery
with chasteness of sea-girls
                                	         Will I complete the mystery
of my flesh
I will rise
        	After a thousand years
lipping
flowers
             And set my teeth in the silver of the moon

Songs (I)
 
 (thee will i praise between those rivers whose
white voices pass upon forgetting(fail
me not)whose courseless waters are a gloat
of silver;o'er whose night three willows wail,
a slender dimness in the unshapeful hour
making dear moan in tones of stroked flower;
let not thy lust one threaded moment lose:
haste)the very shadowy sheep float
free upon terrific pastures pale,
 
whose tall mysterious shepherd lifts a cheek
teartroubled to the momentary wind
with guiding smile,lips wisely minced for blown
kisses,condemnatory fingers thinned
of pity—so he stands counting the moved
myriads wonderfully loved,
(hasten,it is the moment which shall seek
all blossoms that do learn,scents of not known
musics in whose careful eyes are dinned;
 
and the people of perfect darkness fills
his mind who will their hungering whispers hear
with weepings soundless,saying of "alas
we were chaste on earth we ghosts:hark to the sheer
cadence of our grey flesh in the gloom!
and still to be immortal is our doom;
but a rain frailly raging whom the hills
sink into and their sunsets,it shall pass.
Our feet tread sleepless meadows sweet with fear")
 
then be with me:unseriously seem
by the perusing greenness of thy thought
my golden soul fabulously to glue
in a superior terror;be thy taut
flesh silver,like the currency of faint
cities eternal—ere the sinless taint
of thy long sinful arms about me dream
shall my love wholly taste thee as a new
wine from steep hills by darkness softly brought—
 
(be with me in the sacred witchery
of almostness which May makes follow soon
on the sweet heels of passed afterday,
clothe thy soul's coming merely,with a croon
of mingling robes musically revealed
in rareness:let thy twain eyes deeply wield
a noise of petals falling silently
through the far-spaced possible nearaway
from huge trees drenched by a rounding moon)

Songs (II)
 
 when life is quite through with
and leaves say alas,
much is to do
for the swallow,that closes
a flight in the blue;

when love's had his tears out,
perhaps shall pass
a million years
(while a bee dozes
on the poppies,the dears;

when all's done and said,and
under the grass
lies her head
by oaks and roses
deliberated.)


---
Songs (IX)
 
 when god lets my body be

From each brave eye shall sprout a tree
fruit that dangles therefrom

the purpled world will dance upon
Between my lips which did sing

a rose shall beget the spring
that maidens whom passion wastes

will lay between their little breasts
My strong fingers beneath the snow

Into strenuous birds shall go
my love walking in the grass

their wings will touch with her face
and all the while shall my heart be

With the bulge and nuzzle of the sea

Amores (I)
 
 your little voice 
                              Over the wires came leaping 
and i felt suddenly 
dizzy 
          With the jostling and shouting of merry flowers 
wee skipping high-heeled flames 
courtesied before my eyes 
                                                or twinkling over to my side 
Looked up 
with impertinently exquisite faces 
floating hands were laid upon me 
I was whirled and tossed into delicious dancing 
up 
Up 
with the pale important 
                                                stars and the Humorous 
                                                                                                moon 
dear girl 
How i was crazy how i cried when i heard 
                                                                              over time

Songs (III)
 
 Always before your voice my soul 
half-beautiful and wholly droll 
is as some smooth and awkward foal, 
whereof young moons begin 
the newness of his skin, 

so of my stupid sincere youth 
the exquisite failure uncouth 
discovers a trembling and smooth 
Unstrength,against the strong 
silences of your song; 

or as a single lamb whose sheen 
of full unsheared fleece is mean 
beside its lovelier friends,between 
your thoughts more white than wool 
My thought is sorrowful: 

but my heart smote in trembling thirds 
of anguish quivers to your words, 
As to a flight of thirty birds 
shakes with a thickening fright 
the sudden fooled light.

it is the autumn of a year: 
When through the thin air stooped with fear, 
across the harvest whitely peer 
empty of surprise 
death's faultless eyes 

(whose hand my folded soul shall know 
while on faint hills do frailly go 
The peaceful terrors of the snow, 
and before your dead face 
which sleeps,a dream shall pass) 

and these my days their sounds and flowers 
Fall in a pride of petaled hours, 
like flowers at the feet of mowers 
whose bodies strong with love 
through meadows hugely move. 

yet what am i that such and such 
mysteries very simply touch 
me,whose  heart-wholeness overmuch 
Expects of your hair pale, 
a terror musical? 

while in an earthless hour my fond 
soul seriously yearns beyond 
this fern of sunset frond on frond 
opening in a rare 
Slowness of  gloried air... 

The flute of morning stilled in noon— 
noon the implacable bassoon— 
now Twilight seeks the thrill of moon, 
washed with a wild and thin 
despair of violin

Songs (IV)
 
 Thy fingers make early flowers of
all things.
thy hair mostly the hours love:
a smoothness which
sings,saying
(though love be a day)
do not fear,we will go amaying.

thy whitest feet crisply are straying.
Always
thy moist eyes are at kisses playing,
whose strangeness much
says;singing
(though love be a day)
for which girl art thou flowers bringing?

To be thy lips is a sweet thing
and small.
Death,Thee i call rich beyond wishing
if this thou catch,
else missing.
(though love be a day
and life be nothing,it shall not stop kissing).

Songs (V)
 
 All in green went my love riding 
on a great horse of gold 
into the silver dawn.

four lean hounds crouched low and smiling 
the merry deer ran before. 

Fleeter be they than dappled dreams 
the swift sweet deer 
the red rare deer. 

Four red roebuck at a white water 
the cruel bugle sang before. 

Horn at hip went my love riding 
riding the echo down 
into the silver dawn. 

four lean hounds crouched low and smiling 
the level meadows ran before. 

Softer be they than slippered sleep 
the lean lithe deer 
the fleet flown deer. 

Four fleet does at a gold valley 
the famished arrow sang before. 

Bow at belt went my love riding 
riding the mountain down 
into the silver dawn. 

four lean hounds crouched low and smiling 
the sheer peaks ran before. 

Paler be they than daunting death 
the sleek slim deer 
the tall tense deer. 

Four tall stags at a green mountain 
the lucky hunter sang before. 

All in green went my love riding 
on a great horse of gold 
into the silver dawn. 

four lean hounds crouched low and smiling 
my heart fell dead before.

Songs (VI)
 
 Where's Madge then,
Madge and her men?
buried with
Alice in her hair,
(but if you ask the rain
he'll not tell where.)

beauty makes terms
with time and his worms,
when loveliness
says sweetly Yes
to wind and cold;
and how much earth
is Madge worth?
Inquire of the flower that sways in the autumn
she will never guess.
but i know

Songs (VII)
 
 Doll's boy ’s asleep 
under a stile 
he sees eight and twenty 
ladies in a line 

the first lady 
says to nine ladies 
his lips drink water 
but his heart drinks wine 

the tenth lady 
says to nine ladies 
they must chain his foot 
for his wrist ’s too fine 

the nineteenth 
says to nine ladies 
you take his mouth 
for his eyes are mine. 

Doll's boy ’s asleep 
under the stile 
for every mile the feet go 
the heart goes nine

Songs (VIII)
 
 cruelly,love 
walk the autumn long; 
the last flower in whose hair, 
thy lips are cold with songs 

for which is 
first to wither,to pass? 
shallowness of sunlight 
falls and,cruelly, 
across the grass 
Comes the 
moon 

love,walk the 
autumn 
love,for the last 
flower in the hair withers; 
thy hair is acold with 
dreams, 
love thou art frail 

—walk the longness of autumn 
smile dustily to the people, 
for winter 
who crookedly care.

 there is a 
moon sole 
in the blue 
night 

             amorous of waters 
tremulous, 
blinded with silence the 
undulous heaven yearns where 

in tense starlessness 
anoint with ardor 
the yellow lover 

stands in the dumb dark

 consider O 
woman this 
my body.
for it has 

lain 
with empty arms 
upon the giddy hills 
to dream of you, 

approve these 
firm unsated 
eyes 
which have beheld 

night's speechless carnival 
the painting 
of the dark 
with meteors 

streaming from playful 
immortal hands 
the bursting 
of the wafted stars 

(in time to come you shall 
remember of this night amazing 
ecstasies       slowly, 
in the glutted 

heart fleet 
flowerterrible 
memories 
shall 

rise,slowly

 as is the sea marvelous
from god's
hands which sent her forth
to sleep upon the world

and the earth withers
the moon crumbles
one by one
stars flutter into dust

but the sea
does not change
and she goes forth out of hands and
she returns into hands

and is with sleep....

love,
         the breaking

of your
               soul
               upon
my lips

Amores (VII)
 
 if i believe 
in death be sure 
of this 
it is 

because you have loved me, 
moon and sunset 
stars and flowers 
gold crescendo and silver muting 

of seatides 
i trusted not, 
                        one night 
when in my fingers 

drooped your shining body 
when my heart 
sang between your perfect 
breasts 

darkness and beauty of stars 
was on my mouth petals danced 
against my eyes 
and down 

the singing reaches of 
my soul 
spoke 
the green-

greeting pale-
departing irrevocable 
sea 
i knew thee death. 

                                  and when 
i have offered up each fragrant 
night,when all my days 
shall have before a certain 

face become 
white 
perfume 
only, 

         from the ashes 
then 
thou wilt rise and thou 
wilt come to her and brush 

the mischief from her eyes and fold 
her 
mouth the new 
flower with 

thy unimaginable 
wings,where dwells the breath 
of all persisting stars

Amores (VIII)
 
 the glory is fallen out of
the sky the last immortal
leaf
is

dead and the gold
year
a formal spasm
in the

dust
this is the passing of all shining things
therefore we also
blandly

into receptive
earth,O let
us
descend

take
shimmering wind
these fragile splendors from
us crumple them hide

them in thy breath drive
them in nothingness
for we
would sleep

this is the passing of all shining things
no lingering no backward-
wondering be unto
us O

soul,but straight
glad feet fearruining
and glorygirded
faces

lead us
into the
serious
steep

darkness

Amores (IX)
 
 i like
to think that on
the flower you gave me when we
loved

            the far-
departed mouth sweetly-saluted
lingers.
              if one marvel

seeing the hunger of my
lips for a dead thing,
i shall instruct
him silently with becoming

steps to seek
your face       and i
entreat,by certain foolish perfect
hours

          dead too,
if that he come receive
him as your lover sumptuously
being

kind
          because i trust him to
your grace,and for
in his own land

he is called death.

Amores (X)
 
 after five
times the poem
of thy remembrance
surprises with refrain

of unreasoning summer
that by responding
ways cloaked with renewal
my body turns toward

thee
again      for the stars have been
finished in the nobler trees and
the language of leaves repeats

eventual perfection
while east deserves of dawn,
i lie at length,breathing
with shut eyes

the sweet earth where thou liest

Amores (XI)
 
 O Distinct
Lady of my unkempt adoration
if i have made
a fragile certain

song under the window of your soul
it is not like any songs
(the singers the others
they have been faithful

to many things and which
die
i have been sometimes true
to Nothing and which lives

they were fond of the handsome
moon   never spoke ill of the
pretty stars         and to
the serene the complicated

and the obvious
they were faithful
and which i despise,
frankly

admitting i have been true
only to the noise of worms,
in the eligible day
under the unaccountable sun)

Distinct Lady
swiftly take
my fragile certain song
that we may watch together

how behind the doomed
exact smile of life's
placid obscure palpable
carnival where to a normal

melody of probable violins dance
the square virtues and the oblong sins
perfectly
gesticulate the accurate

strenuous lips of incorruptible
Nothing      under the ample
sun,under the insufficient
dav under the noise of worms

Amores (II)
 
 in the rain-
darkness,        the sunset
being sheathed i sit and

the holy
city which is your face
your little cheeks the streets
of smiles

your eyes half-
thrush
half-angel and your drowsy
lips where float flowers of kiss

and
there is the sweet shy pirouette
your hair
and then

your dancesong
soul.      rarely-beloved
a single star is
uttered,and i

think
           of you

my father moved through dooms of love

my father moved through dooms of lovethrough sames of am through haves of give,singing each morning out of each nightmy father moved through depths of height
this motionless forgetful whereturned at his glance to shining here;that if (so timid air is firm)under his eyes would stir and squirm
newly as from unburied whichfloats the first who, his april touchdrove sleeping selves to swarm their fateswoke dreamers to their ghostly roots
and should some why completely weepmy father’s fingers brought her sleep:vainly no smallest voice might cryfor he could feel the mountains grow.
Lifting the valleys of the seamy father moved through griefs of joy;praising a forehead called the moonsinging desire into begin
joy was his song and joy so purea heart of star by him could steerand pure so now and now so yesthe wrists of twilight would rejoice
keen as midsummer’s keen beyondconceiving mind of sun will stand,so strictly (over utmost himso hugely) stood my father’s dream
his flesh was flesh his blood was blood:no hungry man but wished him food;no cripple wouldn’t creep one mileuphill to only see him smile.
Scorning the Pomp of must and shallmy father moved through dooms of feel;his anger was as right as rainhis pity was as green as grain
septembering arms of year extendless humbly wealth to foe and friendthan he to foolish and to wise offered immeasurable is
proudly and (by octobering flamebeckoned) as earth will downward climb,so naked for immortal workhis shoulders marched against the dark
his sorrow was as true as bread:no liar looked him in the head;if every friend became his foehe’d laugh and build a world with snow.
My father moved through theys of we,singing each new leaf out of each tree(and every child was sure that springdanced when she heard my father sing)
then let men kill which cannot share,let blood and flesh be mud and mire,scheming imagine, passion willed,freedom a drug that’s bought and sold
giving to steal and cruel kind,a heart to fear, to doubt a mind,to differ a disease of same,conform the pinnacle of am
though dull were all we taste as bright,bitter all utterly things sweet,maggoty minus and dumb deathall we inherit, all bequeath

Sunset
 
Great carnal mountains crouching in the cloudThat marrieth the young earth with a ring,Yet still its thoughts builds heavenward, whence springWee villages of vapor, sunset-proud.—And to the meanest door hastes one pure-browedWhite-fingered star, a little, childish thing,The busy needle of her light to bring,And stitch, and stitch, upon the dead day’s shroud.Poises the sun upon his west, a sparkSuperlative,—and dives beneath the world;From the day’s fillets Night shakes out her locks;List! One pure trembling drop of cadence purled—“Summer!”—a meek thrush whispers to the dark.Hark! the cold ripple sneering on the rocks!

---
Summer Silence 
 
Eruptive lightnings flutter to and froAbove the heights of immemorial hills;Thirst-stricken air, dumb-throated, in its woeLimply down-sagging, its limp body spillsUpon the earth. A panting silence fillsThe empty vault of Night with shimmering barsOf sullen silver, where the lake distilsIts misered bounty.—Hark! No whisper marsThe utter silence of the untranslated stars.

look           the spanglesthat sleep all the year in a dark boxdreaming of being taken out and allowed to shine,the balls the chains red and gold the fluffy threads,
put up your little armsand i’ll give them all to you to hold.every finger shall have its ringand there won’t be a single place dark or unhappy
then when you’re quite dressedyou’ll stand in the window for everyone to seeand how they’ll stare!oh but you’ll be very proud
and my little sister and i will take handsand looking up at our beautiful treewe’ll dance and sing“Noel Noel”

i sing of Olaf glad and big
 
         XXX
i sing of Olaf glad and bigwhose warmest heart recoiled at war:a conscientious object-or
his wellbelovéd colonel(trigwestpointer most succinctly bred)took erring Olaf soon in hand;but--though an host of overjoyednoncoms(first knocking on the headhim)do through icy waters rollthat helplessness which others strokewith brushes recently employedanent this muddy toiletbowl,while kindred intellects evokeallegiance per blunt instruments--Olaf(being to all intentsa corpse and wanting any ragupon what God unto him gave)responds,without getting annoyed"I will not kiss your fucking flag"
straightway the silver bird looked grave(departing hurriedly to shave)
but--though all kinds of officers (a yearning nation's blueeyed pride)their passive prey did kick and curseuntil for wear their clarionvoices and boots were much the worse,and egged the firstclassprivates onhis rectum wickedly to tease by means of skilfully appliedbayonets roasted hot with heat--Olaf(upon what were once knees)does almost ceaselessly repeat"there is some shit I will not eat"
our president,being of whichassertions duly notifiedthrew the yellowsonofabitchinto a dungeon,where he died
Christ(of His mercy infinite)i pray to see;and Olaf,too
preponderatingly becauseunless statistics lie he wasmore brave than me:more blond than you.

La Guerre (I)
 
Humanity i love youbecause you would rather black the boots ofsuccess than enquire whose soul dangles from hiswatch-chain which would be embarrassing for both
parties and because youunflinchingly applaud allsongs containing the words country home andmother when sung at the old howard
Humanity i love you becausewhen you're hard up you pawn yourintelligence to buy a drink and whenyou're flush pride keeps
you from the pawn shop andbecause you are continually committingnuisances but moreespecially in your own house
Humanity i love you because youare perpetually putting the secret oflife in your pants and forgettingit's there and sitting down
on itand because you areforever making poems in the lapof death Humanity
i hate you
